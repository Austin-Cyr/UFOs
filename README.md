# UFOs
Module 11

## Overview of Project
  - In this project we were tasked with creating a web app for Dana with a dynamic table that allows the user to filter 1 of 5 criteria for UFO Sightings to determine if we really are alone in this world. This challenge involved reading data in from javascript file, creating functions build a table from the data, creating a filter to store the selected values by the user and returning the table with just the desired values. By creating the respective HTML file, we added styling via Bootrap and CSS to the headers, filtered section and results table. 

## Results
 - The resulting webpage and dynamic tables will allow the user to research UFO activity on multiple criteria to their liking. The filter options include: 
      1. Date
      2. City
      3. State
      4. Country
      5. Shape

  - The user will be able to enter in their criteria freehand and the web app will return the results upon entry and the tab/enter keystrokes.

  - Based on the significant presumed contact in not just one geographic area, time frame or physical site, it seems that we are not alone in this universe. 
  

## Summary
  - The finished web app creates a visual representation of data that allows the user to dynamically and quickly search upon their desired criteria in a quick and efficient manner. The table and layout are visually pleasing and engaging to the user to determine for themselves if we are alonw in the universe. If I were to consider one drawback of the design, I would state that the filtered inputs do not react well to typos or misspellings. An example would be if I entered "Bonito" or "Bonita" instead of "bonita", I would not return any results. Thus, the user's searching skills will be limited to the spellings and case sensitivity of the data. 
  - In order to support this drawback, I would recommend updating the code to allow for case sensitive entries by the user. Another option, woudl be to provide a drop down menu for those search criteria where a limit search option is available. For example, the drop down for state would show "TN" or "CA" so that the user knows they are not to spell out the state of "Tennessee."
  -  Another area of further development would allow for the "Jumbotron" to freeze at the top of the web app so that the user has a title of what the web page is while scrolling. 
  -  I could also see the need or desire to export the filtered criteria in an excel or csv file for sharing our analysis outside of the web app.
